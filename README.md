## Fall 2023 Final Project
### Exploring the Impact of Meditation on Selective Attention and Mood
This is the Final Project I created in PSY 598: Behavioral Data Science I graduate level course. 
Within this folder, you can find the original Project Poposal (a brief description of the project
with some preliminary data analyses), the datasets used, and the rendered PDF of the final project.

The goal of this project was to select an open-sourced datascience and explore and visualize three 
research questions. 

### Research Questions
I chose to ask the broad questions: Does meditation influence an individual’s selective attention?
More specifically, looking into these three more specific questions:
1) Does meditation moderate an individual’s selective attention over time?
2) How do different types of meditation moderate an individual’s selective attention
over time?
3) How does meditation affect average daily mood over time?

## Spring 2024 Final Project
### Predicting Online Gambling Behavior: A Machine Learning Approach

### Overview
This was the Final Project I created for my PSY 598: Behavioral Data Science II course.

The purpose of this final project is to analyze a dataset of my choice, showcasing my proficiency in data 
analysis and machine learning techniques. For this project, I chose to examine gambling behavior, specifically,
online gambling. Using this dataset, I conducted exploratory data analysis with visualizations, and built four
distinct machine learning models (Boosted Tree, Random Forest, K-means, and KNN models), tuning parameters as 
necessary to optimize model performance. The project involves evaluating the predictive accuracy of these models 
and interpreting their insights within the relevant domain.

### Aims
There are three major aims for this project:
1) Predict wins and loses of gambling.
2) Predict the “types of gamblers” players may be.
3) Explore the win or loss outcome two players playing the same game.

## Fall 2024 Final Project
### Analyzing Young People's Spending Habits Using Open-Source Survey Data

### Overview
This was the Final Project I created for my SDS 510: Data Wrangling Course. Within this folder, you can find the 
dataset used, a brief project description/analysis outline, and the completed final project.

The goal of this project is to leverage large-scale open-source data to explore a dataset of my choice, forming a 
well-argued narrative based on preliminary data analysis. Throughout the semester, I refined my research questions
and methodologies surrounding young people's spending habits, incorporating peer feedback to enhance the project's 
quality. The analysis involves assembling and cleaning data from diverse sources, to create new insights emerge rather 
than replicating existing research. The project also includes a summary that contextualizes my findings surrounding 
young people's spending habits within the scholarly literature and outlines actionable next steps for further investigation.

### Research Questions
1) How can we predict spending habits from a person's demographics and preferences?
2) What comparisions can we make between individual's preferences? How might these preferences be used to predict spending
3) habits?
