# Final Project - PSY 598 - BDS I

## Overview
This is the Final Project I created in PSY 598: Behavioral Data Science I graduate level course. Within this folder, you can find the original Project Poposal (a brief description of the project with some preliminary data analyses), the datasets used, and the rendered PDF of the final project.

The goal of this project was to select an open-sourced datascience and explore and visualize three research questions. 

### Research Questions
I chose to ask the broad questions: Does meditation influence an individual’s selective attention?
More specifically, looking into these three more specific questions:
1) Does meditation moderate an individual’s selective attention over time?
2) How do different types of meditation moderate an individual’s selective attention
over time?
3) How does meditation affect average daily mood over time?


### Data

The dataset I used can be found [here](https://osf.io/w9v28/files/osfstorage).

This data was collected independently by a 33-year old male doctoral student. Each row represents one day of data collection over the course of 900 days. 

The dataset measures a series of variables, but for this project I chose to focus on meditation types and *Stroop test* performance measures. The *Stroop test* is a psychological test used to examine an individual's selective attention. The test asks the participant to name the color of a word that is printed in a different color. For example, saying "blue" when the word "red" is printed in blue ink.

### Analyses
The analyses are as follows: 
- multiple regression modeling
- modeling time series data using variations within ggplot
