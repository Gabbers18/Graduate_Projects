        " **Research Questions**\n",
        " 1. Can we predict poor spending habits from a person's demographics? For example, if a person has more education, will they be less likely to spend more? Another example would be whether age effects spending habits. Does gender effect spending habits? To answer these questions, I would have to calcuate the proportion of spending to income.\n",
        " 2. How do individuals compare to one another across similar circumstances? For example, do people with similar music preferences have similar spending habits? With this, I wanted to create a machnine learning model using many variables as inputs and most likely a combined variable averaging spending habits across individuals."
