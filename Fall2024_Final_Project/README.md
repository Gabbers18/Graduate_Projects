# Fall 2024 Final Project - SDS 510
## Analyzing Young People's Spending Habits Using Open-Source Survey Data

### Overview
This is the Final Project I created for my SDS 510: Data Wrangling Course. Within this folder, you can find the dataset used, a brief project description/analysis outline, and the completed final project and python script.

The goal of this project is to leverage large-scale open-source data to explore a dataset of my choice, forming a well-argued narrative based on preliminary data analysis. Throughout the semester, I refined my research questions and methodologies surrounding young people's spending habits, incorporating peer feedback to enhance the project's quality. The analysis involves assembling and cleaning data from diverse sources, to create new insights emerge rather than replicating existing research. The project also includes a summary that contextualizes my findings surrounding young people's spending habits within the scholarly literature and outlines actionable next steps for further investigation.

This dataset utilized for thist study contains massive survey data from young people, ranging from music preferences to spending preferences. This dataset has 1011 individuals represented by each row and 151 variables. Such variables range from general demographics like age, education, or gender, to media or social preferences, like music and movie tastes or number of friends and preferences for drinking and smoking.

## Research Questions
1) How can we predict spending habits from a person's demographics and preferences?
2) What comparisions can we make between individual's preferences? How might these preferences be used to predict spending habits?

## Data 

For this project, I chose a dataset that will allow me to explore young people's spending habits. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://github.com/harsh543/Young-People-Survey-Dataset_Spending-Habits/blob/master/data/responses.csv) and within this repository.
