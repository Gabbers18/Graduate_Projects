## Datasets - BDS I Final Project

The dataset and data dictionary I used for this project can directly be found [here](https://osf.io/w9v28/) and within this repository.

This data was collected independently by a 33-year old male doctoral student. Each row represents one day of data collection over the course of 900 days.
